          <tr><td></td><td></td><td>The purpose of this game is to shoot all the unhealthy foods<br>
          and to get the highest score you can. Developing this game started
          with deciding the objective of the game and how the player would could
          the sprites. A specific script that I focused on was the script that 
          allowed the sprite to move using the left and right arrow keys and pressing
          the up arrow key to launch the projectile upwards. Another distinct script
          that I focused on was the score-keeping script. This script was especially
          important because I had to think of how to increase the difficulty as the
          player got a higher score. Overall the difficulty of making this game 
          included debugging the game so that it worked properly, however this was 
          resolved by finding any illogical gaps in the script.</td>
          <td>My story is about a boy named Bteven Sao who is an average teen. On a 
          strange day he runs into very weird events, but he ends up doing something 
          tragic which leads to his downfall. The process for this project was quite 
          simple. We needed to know several concepts such as if-else statements and 
          defining functions. This project was quite enjoyable because I could express
          my creativity through writing a story. There weren't any problems creating 
          this project. The ascpect of this project that I did not like was the 
          repetitiveness of the programming process. A story that I particulary enjoyed 
          was The Legend of G-Dragon because it was a very descriptive and engaging 
          story. If I could do this over I would make my story longer since it was 
          quite short.</td></tr>
