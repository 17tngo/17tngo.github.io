          <tr><td></td><td></td><td>The purpose of this game is to shoot all the unhealthy foods<br>
          and to get the highest score you can. Developing this game started<br>
          with deciding the objective of the game and how the player would could <br>
          the sprites. A specific script that I focused on was the script that <br>
          allowed the sprite to move using the left and right arrow keys and pressing<br>
          the up arrow key to launch the projectile upwards. Another distinct script<br>
          that I focused on was the score-keeping script. This script was especially<br>
          important because I had to think of how to increase the difficulty as the<br>
          player got a higher score. Overall the difficulty of making this game <br>
          included debugging the game so that it worked properly, however this was <br>
          resolved by finding any illogical gaps in the script.</td></tr>
